ERROR WHEN RUNNING CONTAINER AND IMAGES

1. psycopg2

DEPRECATION: psycopg2 is being installed using the legacy 'setup.py install' method,
because it does not have a 'pyproject.toml' and the 'wheel' package is not
installed. pip 23.1 will enforce this behaviour change. A possible replacement
is to enable the '--use-pep517' option. Discussion can be found at
https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/8559
